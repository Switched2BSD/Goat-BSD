# Goat-BSD
Goat-BSD its a sloppy and experimental FreeBSD based Project that tries to achieve the WoW factor to attract more desktop users to FreeBSD . Support Switched2BSD Channel on YouTube plz

I want to make a fabulous FreeBSD Desktop with eye catching themes .

I will make this project to have a 8Gbytes Ram requirement just to be able to include more stuff but i'm not sure yet.

This project will support amd gpus , older radeon gpus and nvidia gpus that are supported by the latest nvidia driver , any old nvidia gpus will not be supported directly because it would require another driver to be installed.

I'm gonna have a basic FreeBSD system with a special script that would get a highly compressed archive with the root and everything basically , create a highly compressed zstd-19 zfs filesystem on Ram and load everything there. That 19 level zstd compression would probably give us the opportunity to squeeze some more stuff to ram and combined with the superb decompression speed of the zstd it will perform fantastic.

PS1: CultBSD was an older experimental project of mine, if you want to keep working with this project please make me feel like you like what i do , noone wants to build anything for himself, without any ratings on sourceforge or any donations at all even a single dollar that would tell me that i should better stop.
